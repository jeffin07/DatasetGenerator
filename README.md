# DatasetGenerator
This is a Small python script which generate a dataset by your limited data 

# Who is this for
This is for image dataset(currently) if you're doing a classification or detection task and you want to do that with your own cutom dataset
But you only have a limited number of images then this will help you to create a dataset of large number by doing image augmentaion.The purpose of this
repo is if you are new to ML/DL and you need to experiment with your own data which is limited then this a good place to look in 

# How this works
This is based on [imgaug](https://github.com/aleju/imgaug) which has huge features and good documentation.Here we only using some of them to generate a dataset and made it simple.
This is in it's alpha version and need improvement
